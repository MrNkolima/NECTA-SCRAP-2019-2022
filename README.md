# NECTA-SCRAP-2019-2022
These are the python scripts that download each  individual school CSEE necta results from the year 2019 to 2022
## To do download files Just do this:
   + Run **python3 start.py**
### After the program is finished, you will find all school files in their respective folders(Years).
   + I have calculated that the whole files will take about 990+Mb after downloading.
